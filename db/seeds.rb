# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)

# watchlists = Watchlist.create([{name: "Rainy Day Flicks", description: "Perfect for when the weather is bad"}, {name: "Action Favorites", description: "Gets the blood pumping!"}])
# movies = Movie.create([{title: "Star Wars", description:"A long time ago in a galaxy far way", runtime: 120}, {title: "Fight Club", description: "Brad Pitt and Ed Norton punch each other", runtime: 98}])
# joins = WatchlistMovie.create([{movie_id: 1, watchlist_id: 2}, {movie_id: 2, watchlist_id: 1}])
